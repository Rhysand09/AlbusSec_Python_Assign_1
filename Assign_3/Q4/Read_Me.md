# Bank Account Class

This program includes a Python class that represents a bank account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking the balance.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Create an instance of the `BankAccount` class. You can optionally provide an initial balance.
3. Use the `deposit` method to add money to the account.
4. Use the `withdraw` method to remove money from the account. If the withdrawal amount is greater than the current balance, a message will be printed indicating insufficient balance.
5. Use the `check_balance` method to view the current balance.
