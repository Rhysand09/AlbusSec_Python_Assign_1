# Dijkstra's Algorithm Program

This program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. The graph should be represented as a dictionary where the keys are the nodes and the values are dictionaries with the neighbors and their corresponding weights.
3. Call the `dijkstra` function with the graph and the starting node as arguments. The function will return a dictionary with the shortest distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
