## Usage

You can use these programs by running them in a Python environment. The searching and sorting functions require an array (and a target element for search functions) as arguments. The `Calculator` class methods require a number as an argument, and the `Programmer` class requires a name, age, and language for initialization. The `matrix_mul` function requires two 2D lists as arguments.
