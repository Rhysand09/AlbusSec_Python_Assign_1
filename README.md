# Python Programs

This repository contains Python programs for various tasks including conditional statements, searching and sorting techniques, and class creation.

## Programs Included

1. Conditional Statements in Python
2. Searching and Sorting Techniques in Python
3. Class Calculator
4. Class Programmer
5. Matrix Multiplication

## Usage

You can use these programs by running them in a Python environment. The searching and sorting functions require an array (and a target element for search functions) as arguments. The `Calculator` class methods require a number as an argument, and the `Programmer` class requires a name, age, and language for initialization. The `matrix_mul` function requires two 2D lists as arguments.

# Python Programs

1. A script that accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generates a list and a tuple which contains every number.
2. A function that converts hours into seconds.
3. A script to automate sending HTTP requests to a web server.
4. A script that extracts the default gateway address from the output of ifconfig or ipconfig and displays it to the user.
5. A script to generate strong passwords of a specified length, including a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Usage

Run the scripts in a Python environment.
